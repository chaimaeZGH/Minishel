Recursive Tree Construction Logic
Input: A list of tokens (char **tokens, or a linked list, etc.).

Step 1: Search for the last pipe (|).

>> If you find one:

	Split the tokens into two parts:

	left = before last pipe

	right = after last pipe

	Create a node with command = "|".

	Recursively build left_subtree and right_subtree, and assign them to left and right.

>> If no pipe found:

	This is a single command.

	Create a node with command = full_command_string.

	Set left = NULL, right = NULL.
